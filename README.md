# 🧠 Building a Brain

Welcome to the "Building a Brain" project! This repository contains the code and resources for simulating or developing a brain-like system using artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that mimics certain aspects of how a human brain functions. This may include learning from data, making decisions, recognizing patterns, and improving over time.

Key objectives:
- Simulate brain-like neural structures
- Implement learning algorithms
- Enable decision-making or classification
- Visualize training and predictions

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Custom neural network implementation (or using frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- 📊 Training and validation on sample datasets
- 🧪 Performance evaluation and analysis
- 🖼️ Visualization of neuron activations or results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
